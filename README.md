# i18n-helper README

i18n-helper is a collection of tools that allows you to peek at the value of a translation key and search for a particular JSON path.
It can be used for general JSON purposes but peeking has been limited to finding JSON paths consisting of dots and no brackets.

## Features

- Copy a JSON path from a JSON file
- Copy and search a JSON path from a JSON file
- Peek at the value of a JSON path in code, either from the cursor position or selection

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[Peeking at the value of a JSON path in code\]\(assets/i18n-helper-peeking.png\)
